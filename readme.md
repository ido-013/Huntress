# Project(Game) Name : Huntress

Artillery Game, 2D Turn-Based Strategy Game

## Game Explain

It is a game that is largely divided into stores and combat sectors. 
With the store division, you can buy items or upgrade them with the goods you get from the battle. 
In the combat sector, it is a game in which elements such as wind and gravity are estimated and the angle of launch and the force of launch are adjusted to defeat the enemy.

The following keyboard controls are used in this project:

+ Move
- `A`, `D`: Move left and right
+ Projectile Power
- `W`, `S`: Power Increase/Decrease
+ Projectile Fire
- `Left Click`: Fix the angle (toggle : Fix free)
